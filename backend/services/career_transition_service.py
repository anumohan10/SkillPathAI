# 💼 Career Transition Strategy for {target_role}

Follow this step-by-step roadmap to maximize your chances of a successful career transition:

1. **Build transferable skills** - Focus first on {', '.join(missing_skills[:3])} through the recommended courses above
2. **Create a transition portfolio** - Develop 2-3 projects that showcase your new {target_role} skills while leveraging your existing expertise in {', '.join(transferable_skills[:2] if transferable_skills else ['your field'])}
3. **Bridge your experience** - Reframe your resume to highlight how your background in {strong_skills[0] if strong_skills else 'your current role'} is relevant to {target_role} positions
4. **Network strategically** - Connect with current {target_role}s on LinkedIn and professional communities to understand the industry's needs
5. **Target transitional roles** - Look for hybrid positions that value both your existing expertise and your new skills

With dedicated effort on this plan, most career changers can successfully transition within 3-6 months.
